### Architecture
For a architecture overview, see the intoduction page [here](../intro/intro.md).

This page is supposed to describe in details how benchmarks are built and how their parameters are computed including:

1. The process of generating benchmark configurations
2. The process of parameters expansion

Something should be said about what can go wrong, especially, when `extensions` are actively used.
