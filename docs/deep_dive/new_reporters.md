### Advanced Configuration

The purpose of this page is to introduce an idea of reporters - components that can build reports based om benchmark results.

The approach is like this:

1. Introduce what is logged during the course of each benchmark, provide examples.
2. Introduce helper tools that can read log files and write summaries as JSON files.
3. Provide examples of how those summaries can be used to generate useful reports - textual files, JSON summaries and fancy HTML pages.
